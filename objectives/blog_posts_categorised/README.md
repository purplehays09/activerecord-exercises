# Blog Posts

## Situation:

> This exercise builds upon the previous "blog post" exercise. The new parts
> of this situation are highlighted in **bold**.

Your application represents a blog. You wish to be able to write
posts containing a title, and content. **You also want to add a category to your
blog posts to make it easier to present different types of content in different ways.**


## Acceptance Criteria:

In a Rails console I can:

- Create a new post with a title, content, and a category
- Access a list of available categories
- Access a list of posts for a particular category
- Remove a post from a category without removing the post itself


## Extensions:

> Extensions represent additional tasks you can complete if you would like to try out a few more
> things. The acceptance criteria does not have tests included, but you are welcome to write them 
> to the test file yourself.

After adding a single category to your posts, you have now found that this is insufficient and you
actually need to orgnanise a single post into one or more categories. Make the necessary adjustments
to the data structure to allow this.

Acceptance criteria:

In a Rails console I can:

- Create a new post with a title, content, and one or more categories
- Add a category to an existing post
- Remove a category from an existing post

To a person I can:

- Explain the different ways of creating many-to-many relationships using Rails
- Explain the pros and cons of the different options above
