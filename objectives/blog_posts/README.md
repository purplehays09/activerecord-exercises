# Blog Posts

## Scenario:

Your application represents a blog. You wish to be able to write
posts containing a title, and content. Once you have posts in your database,
you will be able to start presenting this content using an API or views.

## Acceptance Criteria:

In a Rails console I can:

- Create a new post with a title, and content
- Update the content of an existing post
- Remove a post that already exists
- Access a list of all posts that exist

## Extensions:

> Extensions represent additional tasks you can complete if you would like to try out a few more
> things. The acceptance criteria does not have tests included, but you are welcome to write them 
> to the test file yourself.

You would like to use a post title as a "slug" to use in the URL to view a single post.
To facilitate this, post titles should be unique. Find a way of adding a uniqueness constraint to your post's "title" attribute.

Acceptance criteria:

In a Rails console:

- A post is created with the title "test"
- When another post is created with the title "test", an error is raised

Allow your posts to be written in Markdown. To do this, you will need to find ad
install a gem dependency that makes methods to transform Markdown into HTML available
to you.

Acceptance criteria:

In a Rails console:

- A post is created with content of "**This is a markdown post**."
- The post body, transformed to HTML can be read using a method such as "body_html"
- The post body, untransformed can still be read
